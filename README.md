# AllergyPal
### Created by Jacob Foster & Kyle Andrade

AllergyPal is a digital food safety aid designed to mitigate the risk of trying new foods.

A user simply has to type their allergies into the text box and take a photo of their food, we handle the rest.

A machine learning model trained on 100+ different dishes detects the name of your dish. Then OpenAI determines
common ingredients in that food and cross references is it to the user's list of dietary restrictions. The user is then directed to a page
that notifies them of any risk.
